Here is a set of exercises in the Leetcoder style
for exploring important algorithm topics.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

The Breadth is a method for traversing a graph.  In
it, the program traverses all nodes at the current
depth before going to the next level.

- BFS shortest path

## Depth-First Search

The depth first search uses a recursive method to
traverse nodes all depth.
